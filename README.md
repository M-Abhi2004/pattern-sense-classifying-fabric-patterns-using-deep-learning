🧠 Overview
Fabric pattern classification is a crucial task in textile manufacturing and fashion e-commerce. This project leverages a CNN-based deep learning model to automatically classify fabric images into predefined categories such as:

Floral

Geometric

Striped

Dotted

Abstract

Plain

📂 Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of labeled fabric pattern images collected from online fashion stores and open-source repositories. Each category contains approximately 500–1000 images resized to 128x128.

Classes:
['floral', 'geometric', 'striped', 'dotted', 'abstract', 'plain']
